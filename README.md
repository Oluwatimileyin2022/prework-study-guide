# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This was a project intended to introuduce me to the world of a developer. I learnt the different aspects of a webpage and what makes a good webpage. I also learn to think like a developer and that mistakes and failures are part of the growth process when learning coding. I learnt to use core applications like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I designed a website that summarises the keypoints I learnt during the prework. I learnt that HTML is like the structure of the webpage, what gives the webpage a good foundation and CSS is like adding colours and making the webpage look more pretty and JavaScript is to increase interaction with users.
